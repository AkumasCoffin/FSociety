## Description

Being tired of having to re-image your Shark Jack and going through the hassle of backing up and restoring the device? These shell scripts will help you to backup and restore all important data on your Shark Jack.

The scripts has been created in a modular fashion which allows easy extending the scripts with new functions. The backup script (`backup.sh`) incorporates logic to determine already existing backup folders and create a new (unique) backup folder every time the script is executed.

## backup.sh

This section describes the `backup.sh` shell script.

### Use

1. Execute the script with: `bash ./backup.sh`
